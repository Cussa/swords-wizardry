- Add missing Int and Cha stats
  - % to know spell
  - Min/max spells/level
  - Retainer reaction adjust
- Fix up stats in template and standardize on camelCase
  - other treasure should not be a number in the char sheet
- Auto-calculate stats from abilities
- Better support for ascending AC
- Actual attacks and damage application via targeting
- Alternative initiative types via settings.
- Calculate carry weight
- Support for quatity of darts
- Fix spell memorization to support memorizing the same spell multiple times.
- Maybe a HUD? (or is that verging too far into the land of excess automation?)
