### TODOs

- Polish up the new initiative
  - better roll messages
  - etc
- Polish up the new combat
  - Damage application via targeting
  - Actual support for ascending AC
- Support for quantity of darts on sheet
- Alternative initiative types via settings.
- Maybe verging too far into the land of excess automation
  - Calculate carry weight?
  - Auto-calculate stats from abilities?
  - a token HUD?
  - ammo consumed by ranged attacks?
