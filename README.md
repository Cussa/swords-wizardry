### TODOs

- Polish up the new combat
  - Damage application via targeting
- Polish up the new initiative
  - better roll messages
  - etc
- Token Hud improvements
  - show only memorized spells
- clean up spell memorization
  - make code pretty, move to methods on actor and item from actor-sheet.
  - alert when you can't memorize
- fix all the places where localization was skipped
- Support for ascending AC
- Support for quantity of missile weapons (like darts) on sheets
- Support for alternative initiative types
- Maybe verging too far into the land of excess automation:
  - ammo consumed by ranged attacks?
  - Calculate carry weight?
  - Auto-calculate stats from abilities?
